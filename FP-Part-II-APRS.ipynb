    "In this part of the project we are going to experiment with digital modulation and communication. Network communication systems have layered architechtures. The bottom layer is the physical layer which implements the modulation. Here we will use your [AFSK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying) modules that you implemented in Lab 4 Part I. In addition, we will leverage [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html), which is an amateur-radio data-link layer protocol. [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html) is a packet based protocol that will help us transmit data using packets. It implements basic synchronization, addressing, data encapsulation and some error detection.  In the ham world, an implementation of AFSK and [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html)  together is also called a [TNC ( Terminal Node Controller )](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller). In the past, TNCs were separate boxes that hams attached to their radios to communicate with packet-based communication. An example is [TNC-X](http://tnc-x.com). Today, it is easy to implement TNCs in software using the Raspberry Pi and a sound extension.... as you will see here! \n",

    "Since we can't guarantee that everyone will have access to a radio, a callsign, and an APRS IGate close enough for the attenuated radios to reach, we have adjusted this lab to emulate RF infrastructure with a popular software TNC called direwolf. Since direwolf was designed to be able to transmit and receive RF signals through a sound card, we can emulate an RF channel by connecting our code's transmissions to direwolf through the same audio loopback we used in Lab 4. This section will set up direwolf and the audio loopback."

    "\n",
    "Before we go to demodulate AFSK1200 we will construct data in the form of AX.25 packets. The structure of the AX.25 packet, and in particular the flag that starts and ends a frame will help us sync to the beginning of the packet for accurate demodulation. \n",
    "The AX.25 protocol uses several measures for standardization and to improve detection and demodulation of packets. We will go over them now:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NRZI (non-return to zero inverted)\n",
    "AX.25 does not encode  NRZ '1's and '0's in the usual mark and space frequencies. Instead it uses a scheme called NRZI, or non-return to zero inverted.  NRZI encodes a '0' bit as a change from mark to space, or space to mark. A '1' is encoded as no change.  To encode an AX.25 packet we need to convert our bit sequence to an NRZI one.  For example, an original bit stream of 11011000 should be first converted to 11000101 (initial state is 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bit Stuffing\n",
    "Because a '1' is represented by no change, sending a long string of '1's would result in a constant signal. Receivers, similar to the one you designed in Lab 4, uses phase-locked-loops to synchronize on bit changes. So a long constant signal may result in a receiver drifting out of sync with the transmitter. In order to circumvent this, the encoder performs bit stuffing before transmition by placing   a bit '0' after every fifth '1' in the the stream. The decoder does bit unstuffing and removes the extra '0's. Bit stuffing is performed before converting to NRZI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bit Order\n",
    "Bytes are sent least-significant-bit first\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flag\n",
    "A Flag field starts and ends each packet. It is a unique sequence and is used to detect the beginning and the end of packets. The flag consists of the bit sequence: 0x7E or: 01111110. The flag is an exception in which no bit stuffing is performed. Therefore it is the only place in the packet in which 6 consecutive '1's appear. In NRZI it will translate to a time interval of 7 bits between zero-crossings of the non-coherent detector output.  This means that we can use the flag sequence to uniquely detect the beginning and the end of a packet. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frame Structure\n",
    "The AX.25 protocol defines several types of frames, or packets. We will use the Un-numbered Information (UI) frame as defined in the protocol. A UI frame is used for connectionless mode, where AX.25 frames are transmitted without expecting any response, and reception is not guaranteed. This is similar to UDP in concept (however UDP is a transport layer protocol).\n",
    "The  [Automatic Positioning and Reporting System (APRS)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) protocol uses UI frames. The UI frame has 9 fields of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| flag | Dest. Addr. | Src. Addr. |Digipeater Addresses | Control field | ID | Information Field | FCS | Flag |\n",

    "Of importance are the Source address, which are your call sign, the Information Field which is the packet payload, and the FCS which is an error checksum.\n",

    "## Automatic Positioning and Reporting System (APRS) (information from: [Here](http://www.aprs.org/doc/APRS101.PDF) and [here](http://www.aprs.org/iss-aprs/issicons.html))\n",
    "APRS is a ham packet-based system for real-time tactical digital communication for local area. APRS uses the AX.25 protocol in its core. Using APRS you can report position, status, and send messages that other hams or stations with APRS capability will be able to decode, interpret and display the information. APRS also provides means of packet repeating (Digipeaters) alongside internet terminal nodes. Some radio manufacturers saw the potential and included APRS in some of their products as well. Go to [this website](https://aprs.fi) to see the APRS activity in the surrounding area that is aggregated from the internet nodes. You will see fixed stations, weather stations, and mobile operators in your area. We will use the website to confirm that our transmitted packets were received. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequencies\n",
    "The national APRS frequency is 144.39MHz (ch-99 on your radio). There is much activity and infrastracture transmitting and listenning to that frequency. The international space station also has an APRS digipeater on board operating at 145.825MHZ (ch-50 on your radio). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### EE123 APRS frequency\n",
    "To prevent interference with others while we experiment with APRS, I have set up an APRS station in Cory hall. It will monitor the XPMT4U channel (ch-78),  443.670MHz on your radio. It has an internet link as well. Use this frequency especially if you are present in Cory Hall. If you are far from campus, this may not work. In that case, switch to the APRS frequency 144.39 (ch-99). Check out the website (http://aprs.fi) to see if there are any internet nodes near your home.\n",
    "\n",
    "### APRS Destination, Source, Digipeater Address, Control, ID and FCS packet fields\n",
    "APRS uses AX.25 with UI packets. This enables the use of any AX.25 modem with APRS. But the content of the UI packets is unique to APRS, and the information is used in a very particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For APRS packets, the Destination Address field is not used for routing. Instead it represents the version of the APRS software you are using. In order to be decoded by receivers in the APRS network it must start with the letters AP. We will use **`APCAL`** just for fun. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Source Address is **your call sign**. The Digipeater Addresses require some explanation, but the fields 'WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1' will result in the packet being digipeated a maximum of 2 hops. Using 'WIDE1-1' will result in a single hop which, in dense population areas like the Bay Area, is enough to get your packet to its destination. The Control and ID fields in APRS packets are fixed to \"\\x03\" and \"\\xF0\" respectively. The FCS field is the checksum field that is used to verify the packet integrity, as defined by AX.25. The flag fields are the usual 01111110.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have prepared for you code that generates a valid bitstream of AX.25 packets from the appropriate fields as well as decodes the fields from a bitstream. The code is a modification of code originally written by Greg Albrecht W2GMD. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have the file ``ax25.py`` in your working directory"

    "### The APRS information field\n",
    "The information field of the packet is a 256 Byte payload that contain the information you want to send. We will go over some of the information that is needed to construct valid and useful information field messeges. There are several digipeaters in the Bay Area that have internet terminal nodes. These implement several \"fun\" and useful services. For example, you can send a position report that would show up on a google map. You can also send a short EMAIL or an SMS test message by sending an APRS packet. In fact, we have our own APRS internet terminal node on Cory Hall!\n",
    "\n",
    "How a node or a client interprets your packet depends on the information field structure. The APRS system considers three types of packets: Position, Status and Message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Messages\n",
    "The format of a message payload is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Just begin your packet line with a colon and a 9 character TOADDRESS, another colon and then text. \n",
    "The TOADDRESS must have 9 characters and should be filled with spaces if it is smaller. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* :ALL❏❏❏❏❏❏:Everyone with capable radios that capture this message will display this text.\n",
    "* :KK6MRI❏❏❏:This message will only show on Miki's APRS enabled Yaezu VX-8dr radio screen\n",

    "* :WXBOT❏❏❏❏:94720 \n",
    "\n",
    "The message to WXBOT will result in an APRS message sent back to you with weather information at Berkeley. You will need to be receiving APRS messages at the time!\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"❏❏❏❏❏\" are blank spaces to fill the field to 9 characters.  \n",

    "Here's a link for information about [SMSGTE](https://smsgte.wixsite.com/smsgte) and [WXBOT](https://sites.google.com/site/ki6wjp/wxbot)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some radios implement message numbering, so packet repeating can be tracked. To number your message add the curly brackets symbol followed by the number. Often servers will acknowledge by sending you a confirmation back. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first time you want to send an email to Miki put `{1` at the end of the message. second time put `{2` etc. \n",
    "* :EMAIL-2❏❏:mikilustig@berkeley.edu This message will send miki an email{1\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Position\n",
    "You can report your position to people on the APRS system. If your report is picked up by a node it will show up on http://www.aprs.fi. The basic format of a position packet is:\n",
    "\n",

    "| =             |2759.16N |/|08655.30E|[|I'm on the top of the world! (Mt. Everest)|\n",
    "\n",
    "The latitude format is expressed as a fixed 8-character field, in degrees and decimal minutes (up to two decimal places), followed by a letter N for north and S for south. Latitude minutes are expressed as whole minutes and hundredths of a minute, separated by a decimal point. Longitude is expressed as a fixed 9-character field, in degrees and decimal minutes (to two decimal places), followed by the letter E for east or W for west. Longitude degrees are in the range 000 to 180. Longitude minutes are expressed as whole minutes and hundredths of a minute, separated by a decimal point.\n",
